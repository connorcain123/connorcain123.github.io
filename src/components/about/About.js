            <h1 className="section-title">A little bit about me</h1>
                <p className="about-text">I am an Otago Polytechnic graduate with a bachelorsâ€™ degree in information technology. 
                    I enjoy problem solving, thinking logically as well as being creative therefore studying 
                    IT was a no brainer. Whilst at Otago Polytechnic I gained many professional and technical 
                    skills as well as a series of methodologies which allowed me to work alongside my fellow 
                    students to design and create many awesome projects.
                    <br /><br />
                    I think the most exciting thing about this industry is the fact that it is constantly 
                    evolving and there are constantly new things to create, learn and explore. Now that my 
                    course has finished, I am eager to start a career in the industry, where I can not only 
                    continue to learn and grow, but also start to apply my passion for problem-solving and 
                    helping others. When I am not sitting in front of a monitor, I enjoy skateboarding, 
                    being outside and attending local music gigs with my friends.
